There are three pages:
1. My home page: my image, major/school information, link to my email, link to my favorite website (new york times)
2. Experiences page: has places where I've worked or voluenteered
3. Projects page: has description of CS and engineering projects I am working on or have worked on. For one of my projects
I included a figma link and screenshot. 

I enjoyed working on this assignment and look forward to working on it more over the summer 
and publish on Columbia's domain.
