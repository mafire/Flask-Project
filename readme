There are three pages:
1. My home page: has my image and major/school information
2. Experiences page: has places where I've worked or voluenteered
3. Projects page: has description of CS and engineering projects I am working on or have worked on. For one of my projects
I included a figma link and screenshot. 

I had no trouble completing this assignment and look forward to working on it more over the summer 
and publish on Columbia's domain.
